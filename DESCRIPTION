Description: binomialDP package aids the process of analyzing differentially private data 
    by offering a tool to perform statistical inference on differentially 
    private binomial data. This package includes functions for the Tulap 
    distributions, deriving UMP tests, calculating the p-values, and computing 
    confidence intervals.
