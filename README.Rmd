## Overview

The `binomialDP` package makes it easy to perform differentially private
inference for a population proportion in R. The package offers a quick solution
to find differentially private uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests, private
p-values, and private confidence intervals. Also included in the package are the
CDF function and the random deviate generator of the Truncated-Uniform-Laplace
(Tulap) distribution.


## Installation

To install the package, run one of the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## The latest official version from CRAN
install.packages("binomialDP")
library(binomialDP)

## The latest development version from Github
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ttran2401/binomialDP")
```

## Examples

Refer to the package vignette for more information.
